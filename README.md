## Abstract


The New York Civilian Complaint Review Board (“CCRB”) has jurisdiction to “receive,
investigate, mediate, hear, make findings, and recommend action” regarding non-criminal
accusations against New York City Police Department (“NYPD”) officers.When a complaint is
substantiated, the CCRB then recommends a disciplinary action to the police commissioner, who
can accept or modify the recommendation. The June 2020 repeal of New York State law CVR §
50-a, which shielded police disciplinary records from public disclosure, made CCRB’s findings
subject to public access. The purpose of this research is to identify patterns in the types of cases
reported to the CCRB, their investigative outcomes, and ultimately, NYPD’s decisions to impose
discipline in response to substantiated allegations. The CCRB classifies complaints into four
categories: Force, Abuse of Authority, Discourtesy, and Offensive Language. Given the differing
nature of these cases and their associated evidence, we hypothesized that the CCRB would
substantiate allegations of these types at different rates. While the categories of these allegations
are broad, we expected to see substantiated Force allegations penalized more severely than other
types of allegations. Finally, we hypothesized that NYPD would impose discipline on
substantiated CCRB complaints at similar rates across categories. In addition to the CCRB’s
complaint categorization, we aimed to create our own complaint classifications using the
CCRB’s case categorization combined with the number of allegations contained in the case.

#### Data

[__Complaints Against Police Officers:__](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Civilian-Complaint-Review-Board-Complaints-Against/2mby-ccnw/about_data)
The primary table for all public data on complaints, including dates, locations and the outcomes of closed complaints received since the year 2000.

[__Allegations Against Police Officers:__](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Civilian-Complaint-Review-Board-Allegations-Agains/6xgr-kwjq/about_data)
A list of all closed allegations made against uniformed members of the New York Police Department since the year 2000. A single complaint may include multiple allegations between multiple victims / alleged victims and multiple officers. A single allegation is between one complainant and one officer.

[__Penalties:__](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Civilian-Complaint-Review-Board-Penalties/keep-pkmh/about_data)
A table listing recommended and final penalties for each officer with a substantiated complaint of misconduct since the year 2000. Non-charges cases go through the Department Advocate's Office (DAO) and are recorded as non-APU where relevant in the table, while charges cases are prosecuted by the Administrative Prosecution Unit (APU) and are marked as APU penalties and recommendations. In all cases the NYPD Commissioner will issue a final penalty, labeled as "NYPD Officer Penalty" in the dataset.
