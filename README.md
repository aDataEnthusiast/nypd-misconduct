## Abstract


The New York Civilian Complaint Review Board (“CCRB”) has jurisdiction to “receive,
investigate, mediate, hear, make findings, and recommend action” regarding non-criminal
accusations against New York City Police Department (“NYPD”) officers.When a complaint is
substantiated, the CCRB then recommends a disciplinary action to the police commissioner, who
can accept or modify the recommendation. The June 2020 repeal of New York State law CVR §
50-a, which shielded police disciplinary records from public disclosure, made CCRB’s findings
subject to public access. The purpose of this research is to identify patterns in the types of cases
reported to the CCRB, their investigative outcomes, and ultimately, NYPD’s decisions to impose
discipline in response to substantiated allegations. The CCRB classifies complaints into four
categories: Force, Abuse of Authority, Discourtesy, and Offensive Language. Given the differing
nature of these cases and their associated evidence, we hypothesized that the CCRB would
substantiate allegations of these types at different rates. While the categories of these allegations
are broad, we expected to see substantiated Force allegations penalized more severely than other
types of allegations. Finally, we hypothesized that NYPD would impose discipline on
substantiated CCRB complaints at similar rates across categories. In addition to the CCRB’s
complaint categorization, we aimed to create our own complaint classifications using the
CCRB’s case categorization combined with the number of allegations contained in the case.
